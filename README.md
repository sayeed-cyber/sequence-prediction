# sequence-prediction
* This program predicts next number in given sequence
Don't know what exactly i should call is but this program gonna understand the sequence by learning from the given set of numbers 


For eg : if 1,2,3 so its an easy sequence the next number is obviously going to be 4 even a kid can answer it 
But when thing become complex like 1,2,5,6,9,10,? Whats next number is going to be by taking some time and calculation a human can also answer it but this program is gonna be supper fast in that and answer in MS 
But things are going to be more complex ans =2
* 43,32,23,15,8,? Sequence became more complex so it requires some better iq to be fast and calculate for humans but this program can just ......
.
.
.
But things became more complex it was difficult for me too to decode 
* As to teach somebudddy  teacher should be able to solve ðŸ˜… thats y my program also unable to solve some problems
* Like 15,29,56,108,208....expected answer is 400 behind this there is some complex logic i have decoded this answer but dont know how to teach this im searching for algorithms to teach my program 
* I JUST DONT WANT TO CODE EACH EVERY THING I WANT THIS PROGRAM TO TEACH IT SELF AND LEARN FROM MISTAKES  i still dont know how its done as this semester my collage syllabus is also too much im unable to focus on to what to focus its so confusing
But as i sparked this idea i should and must complete it im working on it from 17/oct/2022 ill finish it as soon as possible .




* #BUT UNFORTUNATELY I LOST MY PENDRIVE IN WHICH I WAS CARRYING THAT PROGRAM !ðŸ¥² 
 But problem is not that big iv noted the progress in the form of myðŸ¤¢ handwriting ill i can write it back program is pretty smart but few problams it unable to solve 
So someone good at mathematics can contribute to this project
